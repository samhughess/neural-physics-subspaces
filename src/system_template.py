    def construct(problem_name):

        '''

        Basic philosophy:
            We define the system via two objects, a object instance ('system'), which can
            hold pretty much anything (strings, function pointers, etc), and a dictionary 
            ('system_def') which holds only jnp.array objects.

            The reason for this split is the JAX JIT system. Data stored in the `system`
            is fixed after construction, so it can be anything. Data stored in `system_def`
            can potentially be modified after the system is constructed, so it must consist
            only of JAX arrays to make JAX's JIT engine happy.


        The fields which MUST be populated are:
       
            = System name
            system.system_name --> str
            The name of the system (e.g. "neohookean")
            

            = Problem name
            system.problem_name --> str
            The name of the problem (e.g. "trussbar2")
       

            = Dimension
            system.dim --> int
                The dimension of the configuration space for the system. When we
                learn subspaces that map from `R^d --> R^n`, this is `n`. If the 
                system internally expands the configuration space e.g. to append 
                additional pinned vertex positions, those should NOT be counted 
                here.


            = Initial position
            system_def['init_pos'] --> jnp.array float dimension: (n,)
                An initial position, used to set the initial state in the GUI
                It does not necessarily need to be the rest pose of the system.
            

            = Conditional parameters dimension
            system.cond_dim --> int
                The dimension of the conditional parameter space for the system. 
                If there are no conditional parameters, use 0.
            
            = Conditional parameters value
            system_def['cond_param'] --> jnp.array float dimension: (c,)
                A vector of conditional paramters for the system, defining its current
                state. If there are no conditional parameters, use a length-0 vector.
            

            = External forces
            system_def['external_forces'] --> dictionary of anything
                Data defining external forces which can be adjusted at runtime
                The meaning of this dictionary is totally system-dependent. If unused, 
                leave as an empty dictionary. Fill the dictionary with arrays or other 
                data needed to evaluate external forces.


            = Interesting states
            system_def['interesting_states'] --> jnp.array float dimension (i,n)
                A collection of `i` configuration state vectors which we want to explicitly track
                and preserve.
                If there are no interesting states (i=0), then this should just be a size (0,n) array.


            The dictionary may also be populated with any other user-values which are useful in 
            defining the system.

            NOTE: When you add a new system class, also add it to the registry in config.py
